#employee churn:
#outlined steps to be followed 
#1 to obtain data required 
#2 to perform data cleaning including fixing missing columns 
#3 exploring data with exploratory data analysis 
#4 modelling the data to provide an idea as to whether the employee will leave,
#to use cross validations to examine the models accuracy and tune the models hyperparameters. 
#after predicting any uncertainities optimization will follow 
#a confusion matrix was used to give the precision of the model by providing the number of true positives and 
#true negatives. this can be followed by graphong  an ROC curve to understand the reasoning behind choosing a particular model 
#5finally we interpret the data: and make appropriate conclusions
