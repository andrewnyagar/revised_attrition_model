employee churn classification:
#outlined steps to be followed 
1. to obtain hr_analytics_dataset 
2 to perform data cleaning and preprocessing
3 to performe feature engineering
4 modelling the data to provide an idea as to whether the employee will leave,
5.to use cross validations to examine the models accuracy and tune the models hyperparameters. 
6.after predicting any uncertainities optimization will follow 
7.a confusion matrix was used to give the precision of the model by providing the number of true positives and 
8.finally we interpret the data: and make appropriate conclusions
